                    <p> Tommy Galletta is a current student at the Florida Institute of Technology majoring in
                        Computer Science. He currently works under Dr. Debasis Mitra in the Biomedical Computing Lab
                        on campus. In the lab, he has helped to create simulations for PET and SPECT imaging,
                        as well as working with neural networks to perform basic reconstructions based on simulation
                        data.

                        When he isn't studying, Tommy likes to sing, read, play video games, and play Dungeons & Dragons
                        . He likes performing, and in the future, he hopes to provide entertainment to the world in one
                        way or another.

                    <p> Logan Klaproth is a Junior in the Bachelor's program for Computer Science at Florida Tech with a
                        concentration in Cyber Operations.
                        Last year, he interned in compliance at Northrop Grumman as a Cybersecurity intern.
                        Before that, he worked for the City of Melbourne as a Recreation leader for a team in charge of
                        managing a recreation facility and its events.
                        Following his employment at the City he took an opportunity to study abroad at Oxford University
                        in the United Kingdom.
                        There, he made connections with fellow students, acquired skills for traversing foreign places,
                        and, of course, studied.
                        He was enrolled in Probability and Statistics, taught by Dr. Christina Sebu, and Science and
                        Technical Communications,
                        led by Dr. Agota Marton and Dr. Henry Mead.
                        Outside of classes, he spends a lot of time with my friends planning many social gatherings,
                        such as movie nights and dinners. When heâ€™s alone, however, he likes to spend most of his time
                        working towards skills in vulnerability research, listening to music, or occasionally watching
                        MMA fights on the weekends.

                        She has experience coding in C++, Python, and Java, and is currently studying webapps and using
                        HTML/CSS/Javascript as well as React.js and Node.js. She currently has an internship with Boeing
                        where she develops, modifies, and maintains software for the Starliner spacecraft.

                        Apart from her studies, she enjoy various creative hobbies such as art (including drawing,
                        painting, and sometimes sculpting), photography (especially with film camera), and planning the
                        piano (well a keyboard really). Her goals for the future include graduating with my bachelors
                        degree in Software Engineering, growing her knowledge and expertise in the software/programming
                        world, and traveling to exercise her photography skills.
